Fedora Migration Tools for Linux. The aim of this repository is to provide set of scripts and tools with documentation to migrate fedora workstation from a older version to a more recent and supported version by community. I prefer keeping myself 2 years behind the fedora latest cutting edge rollout. This is to ensure that i get a more stable and working software.

The tools are designed to provide a step by step update and upgrade of all the key software on the previous machine along with configurations and settings so that the overall migration is very smooth and nothing is missed out. These tools include fetching all repositories from bitbucket and git. Tools to reconcile the rpm package lists on new system vs old and account for the delta. Taking care of these new packages and deploying the packages using fcpkgmon.
